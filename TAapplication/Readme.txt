Project---------- TA Application
=========================================================================================

About the project
=================
The project is to create a web page that Professors or university staffs or students could log in and create an application or assign Teaching assistants


Charting
=========
I used the simple line graph to represent the CS courses enrollment.
Database is seeded for CS courses in the given temp.csv file.
The csv file is located in TAapplication folder and it could be reached via 
the relative path @"..\\TAapplication\temp.csv".
Only Administrators could see the Enrollment Trend page.
Courses could be typed in either lowercases or uppercases. White spaces don't matter too.


Note
====
I did not implement mouse drage and spinner functions because of the time constraint. 
Course enrollments could be seen on the graph.
Datepickers GUIs are working on the frontend, but are not connected to the backend.
Spinner is not implemented.


Above and beyond
================
No functionality improvement however I did add nice lookings bootstrap5 features.
